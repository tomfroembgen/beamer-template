	abstract = {Atomic neural networks (ANNs) constitute a class of machine learning methods for predicting potential energy surfaces and physico-chemical properties of molecules and materials. Despite many successes, developing interpretable ANN architectures and implementing existing ones efficiently are still challenging. This calls for reliable, general-purpose and open-source codes. Here, we present a python library named PiNN as a solution toward this goal. In PiNN, we designed a new interpretable and high-performing graph convolutional neural network variant, PiNet, as well as implemented the established Behler-Parrinello high-dimensional neural network. These implementations were tested using datasets of isolated small molecules, crystalline materials, liquid water and an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. PiNN comes with a visualizer called PiNNBoard to extract chemical insight "learned" by ANNs, provides analytical stress tensor calculations and interfaces to both the Atomic Simulation Environment and a development version of the Amsterdam Modeling Suite. Moreover, PiNN is highly modularized which makes it useful not only as a standalone package but also as a chain of tools to develop and to implement novel ANNs. The code is distributed under a permissive BSD license and is freely accessible at https://github.com/Teoroo-CMC/PiNN/ with full documentation and tutorials.},

	abstract = {With the increasing application of template assisted syntheses in deep eutectic solvents and successful application of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents in extraction processes, where microheterogeneity plays a major role, suggestions for novel deep eutectic solvents which exhibit strong microheterogeneity are desirable. Therefore, classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on deep eutectic solvent systems constructed of choline chloride and some of its derivatives mixed with ethylene glycol in a molar composition of 1 : 2 since this is the optimal parent composition. The derivatives consisted of a series of elongated alkyl side chains and elongated alcohol side chains. Of these series only choline chloride ethylene glycol has been investigated experimentally, the other systems are suggested and theoretically investigated as possible target for synthesis. Our domain analysis supported by the clear distinction of polar and nonpolar parts from the electrostatic potentials reveals that strong microheterogeneity within these novel hypothetical deep eutectic solvents exists. Rather stretched than crumbled side chains maximize possible interaction sites for both polar and nonpolar parts which make the suggested compounds valuable objectives for experiments in order to exploit the microheterogeneity in deep eutectic solvents.},

	abstract = {Lmfit provides a high-level interface to non-linear optimization and curve fitting problems for Python. Lmfit builds on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm of scipy.optimize.leastsq(), but also supports most of the optimization method from scipy.optimize.   It has a number of useful enhancements, including:  Using Parameter objects instead of plain floats as variables.  A Parameter has a value that can be varied in the fit, fixed, have upper and/or lower bounds.  It can even have a value that is constrained by an algebraic expression of other Parameter values. Ease of changing fitting algorithms.  Once a fitting model is set up, one can change the fitting algorithm without changing the objective function. Improved estimation of confidence intervals.  While scipy.optimize.leastsq() will automatically calculate uncertainties and correlations from the covariance matrix, lmfit also has functions to explicitly explore parameter space to determine confidence levels even for the most difficult cases. Improved curve-fitting with the Model class.  This which extends the capabilities of scipy.optimize.curve\_fit(), allowing you to turn a function that models for your data into a python class that helps you parametrize and fit data with that model.  Many pre-built models for common lineshapes are included and ready to use.

Distinct fast charging and discharging process frequencies were obtained from the complex capacitance plane extracted from EIS. The onset frequencies of the charging processes were found to be independent of the bulk viscosity of the liquid. [N1114][TFSI] showed the largest relative increase in capacitance with respect to the point of zero charge with applied potential as a result of the ‘crowding’ effect. This is attributed to a larger degree of rotational freedom associated with the independent alkyl chains and the accessibility of larger potentials with the more stable cation. The largest overall capacitance among the ILs studied was observed for [PYR13][TFSI] at its anodic maximum which occurs due to ‘overscreening’. The interpretation of the measured differential capacitance according to the extended mean field theory of Goodwin–Kornyshev [Z. A. Goodwin, et al., Electrochim. Acta., 2017, 225, 190–197] reveals that the ILs with increased ion associations demonstrate the largest relative increase in capacitance with potential.},

We show that a reparametrization of the dihedral potentials as well as charges of the [NTf2] anion leads to an improvement of the force field model introduced by Köddermann, Paschek, and Ludwig [ChemPhysChem 8, 2464 (2007)] (KPL-force field). A crucial advantage of the new parameter set is that the minimum energy conformations of the anion (trans and gauche), as deduced from ab initio calculations and Raman experiments, are now both well represented by our model. In addition, the results for [CnMIm][NTf2] show that this modification leads to an even better agreement between experiment and molecular dynamics simulation as demonstrated for densities, diffusion coefficients, vaporization enthalpies, reorientational correlation times, and viscosities. Even though we focused on a better representation of the anion conformation, also the alkyl chain-length dependence of the cation behaves closer to the experiment. We strongly encourage to use the new NGOLP (Neumann, Golub, Odebrecht, Ludwig, Paschek) force field for the [NTf2] anion instead of the earlier KPL parameter set for computer simulations aiming to describe the thermodynamics, dynamics, and also structure of imidazolium-based ionic liquids.},

We show that PyrH1BF4 containing 0.8 percentage by weight of water is displaying very favorable transport properties and a large electrochemical stability. With the help of molecular dynamics simulations, it is revealed that at these low concentrations the water molecules are dispersed in the ionic liquid and do not form larger aggregates, while arrangements are formed where a water molecule is placed between an anion and cation, forming solvent separated ion pairs. Employing this PIL in EDLCs allows the realization of devices that display higher energy and power in the timeframe of interest for high power systems (few minutes to seconds) compared to those possible with conventional aprotic ionic liquids, even though these latter devices have much higher operative voltages. Considering these results, PyrH1BF4 can therefore be considered as a very interesting electrolyte for the realization of safe and high performance EDLCs.},

The discrepancies are discussed in terms of intra- and intermolecular force field parameters as well as the system size. We report significant differences in the derived diffusion coefficients and attribute them to system size, density and general discrepancies between ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations. In most cases, radial distribution functions show qualitative agreement; however, the overpolarization of chloride in the MD trajectories gives rises to unphysical results. Excellent agreement between dipolar distributions point out the importance of explicit polarizability in MD, while the comparison of computational and experimental IR spectra highlights the similarities between classical and ab initio dynamics in the low-wave number region and the differences around 1500 cm−1.},

	abstract = {This work presents an optimal model management strategy that exploits multiﬁdelity surrogate models to accelerate the estimation of statistics of outputs of computationally expensive high-ﬁdelity models. Existing acceleration methods typically exploit a multilevel hierarchy of surrogate models that follow a known rate of error decay and computational costs; however, a general collection of surrogate models, which may include projection-based reduced models, data-ﬁt models, support vector machines, and simpliﬁed-physics models, does not necessarily give rise to such a hierarchy. Our multiﬁdelity approach provides a framework to combine an arbitrary number of surrogate models of any type. Instead of relying on error and cost rates, an optimization problem balances the number of model evaluations across the high-ﬁdelity and surrogate models with respect to error and costs. We show that a unique analytic solution of the model management optimization problem exists under mild conditions on the models. Our multiﬁdelity method makes occasional recourse to the high-ﬁdelity model; in doing so it provides an unbiased estimator of the statistics of the high-ﬁdelity model, even in the absence of error bounds and error estimators for the surrogate models. Numerical experiments with linear and nonlinear examples show that speedups by orders of magnitude are obtained compared to Monte Carlo estimation that invokes a single model only.},

Nine years after the original publication of TRAVIS, we highlight some of the recent new functions and features in this article. At the same time, we shortly present some of the underlying algorithms in TRAVIS, which contribute to make trajectory analysis more efficient. Some modern visualization techniques such as Sankey diagrams are also demonstrated. Many analysis functions are implemented, covering structural analyses, dynamical analyses, and functions for predicting vibrational spectra from molecular dynamics simulations. While some of the analyses are known since several decades, others are very recent. For example, TRAVIS has been used to compute the first ab initio predictions in the literature of bulk phase vibrational circular dichroism spectra, bulk phase Raman optical activity spectra, and bulk phase resonance Raman spectra within the last few years.},

Using a two-dimensional model system, we first introduce different cluster analysis functions and their application to single snapshots and trajectories including periodicity and temporal propagation. Using molecular dynamics simulations of pure water with varying system size, we show that our cluster analysis is size-independent. Furthermore, we observe a similar clustering behavior of pure water in classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, showing that our cluster analysis is universal. In order to emphasize the application to more complex systems and mixtures, we additionally apply the cluster analysis to ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the [C2C1Im][OAc] ionic liquid and its mixture with water. Using that, we show that our cluster analysis is able to analyze the clustering of the individual components in a mixture as well as the clustering of the ionic liquid with water.},

	abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multiple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive highfidelity model describes the system with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations, where the low-fidelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-fidelity model (e.g., a simplified physics approximation, a reduced model, a data-fit surrogate) that approximates the same output quantity as the high-fidelity model. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are leveraged for speedup while the highfidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity methods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering. The paper reviews multifidelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncertainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

These systems are problematic in polarizable simulations because they contain either small, highly charged ions or strong hydrogen bonds, which cause trajectory instabilities due to the pull exerted on the induced dipoles. We use a Tang–Toennies (TT) function to dampen, or smear, the interactions between charges and induced dipole at a short range involving small, highly charged atoms (such as hydrogen or lithium), thus preventing the “polarization catastrophe”. The new force field gives stable trajectories and is validated through comparison with experimental data on density, viscosity, and ion diffusion coefficients of liquid systems of the above-mentioned classes. The results also shed light on the hydrogen-bonding pattern in ethylammonium nitrate, a PIL, for which the literature contains conflicting views. We describe the implementation of the TT damping function, of the temperature-grouped Nosé–Hoover thermostat for polarizable molecular dynamics (MD) and of the periodic perturbation method for viscosity evaluation from non-equilibrium trajectories in the LAMMPS MD code. The main result of this work is the wider applicability of the CL\&Pol polarizable force field to new, important classes of fluids, achieving robust trajectories and a good description of equilibrium and transport properties in challenging systems. The fragment-based approach of CL\&Pol will allow ready extension to a wide variety of PILs, DES, and electrolytes.},

	abstract = {A general, transferable, polarizable force field for molecular simulation of ionic liquids (ILs) and their mixtures with molecular compounds is developed. This polarizable model is derived from the widely used CL\&P fixed-charge force field that describes most families of ILs, in a form compatible with OPLS-AA, one of the major force fields for organic compounds. Models for ILs with fixed, integer-ionic charges lead to pathologically slow dynamics, a problem that is corrected when polarization effects are included explicitly. In the model proposed here, Drude-induced dipoles are used with parameters determined from atomic polarizabilities. The CL\&P force field is modified upon inclusion of the Drude dipoles to avoid double-counting of polarization effects. This modification is based on first-principles calculations of the dispersion and induction contributions to the van der Waals interactions using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) for a set of dimers composed of positive, negative, and neutral fragments representative of a wide variety of ILs. The fragment approach provides transferability, allowing the representation of a multitude of cation and anion families, including different functional groups, without the need to reparametrize. Because SAPT calculations are expensive, an alternative predictive scheme was devised, requiring only molecular properties with a clear physical meaning, namely, dipole moments and atomic polarizabilities. The new polarizable force field, CL\&Pol, describes a broad set of ILs and their mixtures with molecular compounds and is validated by comparisons with experimental data on density, ion diffusion coefficients, and viscosity. The approaches proposed here can also be applied to the conversion of other fixed-charge force fields into polarizable versions.},

One is parametrized manually, and the other is developed with the gradient-based optimization workflow (GROW). By doing so, we wanted to perform a hard test to determine how researchers could benefit from semiautomated optimization procedures. As with our already published all-atom force field (AA-FF) for [CnMIM][NTf2] (T. Köddermann, D. Paschek, R. Ludwig, ChemPhysChem­ 2007, 8, 2464), the new force fields were derived to fit experimental densities, self-diffusion coefficients, and NMR rotational correlation times for the IL cation and for water molecules dissolved in [C2MIM][NTf2]. In the manual force field, the alkyl chains of the cation and the CF3 groups of the anion were treated as united atoms. In the GROW force field, only the alkyl chains of the cation were united. All other parts of the structures of the ions remained unchanged to prevent any loss of physical information. Structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties such as viscosity, cation rotational correlation times, and heats of vaporization calculated with the new force fields were compared with values simulated with the previous AA-FF and the experimental data. All simulated properties were in excellent agreement with the experimental values. Altogether, the UA-FFs are slightly superior for speed-up reasons. The UA-FF speeds up the simulation by about 100 \% and reduces the demanded disk space by about 78 \%. More importantly, real time and efforts to generate force fields could be significantly reduced by utilizing GROW. The real time for the GROW parametrization in this work was 2 months. Manual parametrization, in contrast, may take up to 12 months, and this is, therefore, a significant increase in speed, though it is difficult to estimate the duration of manual parametrization.},

We show that a reparametrization of the dihedral potentials as well as charges of the [NTf2] anion leads to an improvement of the force field model introduced by Köddermann, Paschek, and Ludwig [ChemPhysChem 8, 2464 (2007)] (KPL-force field). A crucial advantage of the new parameter set is that the minimum energy conformations of the anion (trans and gauche), as deduced from ab initio calculations and Raman experiments, are now both well represented by our model. In addition, the results for [CnMIm][NTf2] show that this modification leads to an even better agreement between experiment and molecular dynamics simulation as demonstrated for densities, diffusion coefficients, vaporization enthalpies, reorientational correlation times, and viscosities. Even though we focused on a better representation of the anion conformation, also the alkyl chain-length dependence of the cation behaves closer to the experiment. We strongly encourage to use the new NGOLP (Neumann, Golub, Odebrecht, Ludwig, Paschek) force field for the [NTf2] anion instead of the earlier KPL parameter set for computer simulations aiming to describe the thermodynamics, dynamics, and also structure of imidazolium-based ionic liquids.},

The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom.

However, many existing force ﬁelds have multiple shortcomings, including poor solvent dynamics, the underestimation of hydrogen-bonding strength, and errors in solvent interactions/organization. A new force ﬁeld, called optimized potentials for liquid simulation-ionic-liquid virtual site (OPLS-VSIL), has been developed for imidazolium-based ionic liquids featuring a novel topology incorporating a virtual site bisecting the nitrogen atoms that oﬄoads negative charge to inside the plane of the ring. Guided by free energy of hydration calculations, an empirically derived set of partial charges and nonbonded Lennard-Jones terms for both 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium and 11 diﬀerent anions provided accurate bulk-phase ionic-liquid properties and produced radial distribution functions nearly indistinguishable from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. For example, overall mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.1−3.4\% were computed for the density, heat of vaporization, and viscosity of approximately 20 diﬀerent ion pair combinations. Additional physical properties, such as, self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients, heat capacity, and surface tension also gave signiﬁcant MAE improvements using OPLS-VSIL compared to the existing ﬁxed-charge ionic-liquid force ﬁelds. Local interactions, including cation−anion hydrogen bonding and π−π stacking between the imidazolium rings, were also accurately reproduced.},

	abstract = {Our OPLS-2009IL force ﬁeld parameters (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 1038−1050) were originally developed and tested on 68 unique ionic liquids featuring the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium [RMIM], N-alkylpyridinium [RPyr], and choline cations. Experimental validation was limited to densities and a few, largely conﬂicting, heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) values reported in the literature at the time. Owing to the use of Monte Carlo as our sampling technique, it was also not possible to investigate the reproduction of dynamics. The [RMIM] OPLS-2009IL parameters have been revisited in this work and adapted for use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition, new OPLS-AA parameters have been developed for multiple anions, i.e., AlCl4−, BF4−, Br−, Cl−, NO3−, PF6−, acetate, benzoate bis(pentaﬂuoroethylsulfonyl)amide, bis(triﬂuoroethylsulfonyl)amide, dicyanamide, formate, methylsulfate, perchlorate, propanoate, thiocyanate, tricyanomethanide, and triﬂuoromethanesulfonate. The computed solvent densities, heats of vaporization, viscosities, diﬀusion coeﬃcients, heat capacities, surface tensions, and other relevant solvent data compared favorably with experiment. A charge scaling of ±0.8 e was also investigated as a means to mimic polarization and charge transfer eﬀects. The 0.8-scaling led to signiﬁcant improvements for ΔHvap, surface tension, and self-diﬀusivity; however, a concern when scaling charges is the potential degradation of local intermolecular interactions at short ranges. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) were used to examine cation−anion interactions when employing 0.8*OPLS-2009IL and the scaled force ﬁeld accurately reproduced RDFs from ab initio MD simulations.},

Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 4572) was used to parametrize the force ﬁeld, in which the eﬀective atom partial charges are ﬁtted by the electrostatic potential surface (ESP) of ion pair dimers to account for the overall eﬀects of polarization in ILs. The total charges (absolute values) on the cation/anion are in the range of 0.64À0.75, which are rescaled to 0.8 for all kinds of ions by a compromise between transferability and accuracy. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed over a wide range of temperatures to validate the force ﬁeld, especially on the enthalpies of vaporization (ΔHvap) and transport properties, including the self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient and shear viscosity. The liquid densities were predicted very well for all of the ILs studied in this work with typical deviations of less than 1\%. The simulated ΔHvap at 298 and 500 K are also in good agreement with the measured values by diﬀerent experimental methods, with a slight overestimation of about 5 kJ/mol. The inﬂuence of ΔCp (the diﬀerence between the molar heat capacity at constant pressure of the gas and that of liquid) on the calculation of ΔHvap is also discussed. The transport coeﬃcients were estimated by the equilibrium MD method using 20À60 ns trajectories to improve the sampling. The proposed force ﬁeld gives a good description of the self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients and shear viscosities, which is comparable to the recently developed polarizable force ﬁeld. Although slightly lower dynamics is found in simulations by our force ﬁeld, the order of magnitude of the selfdiﬀusion coeﬃcient and viscosity are reproduced for all the ILs very well over a wide temperature range. The largest underestimation of the self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient is about one-third of the experimental values, while the largest overestimation of the viscosity is about two times the experimental values.},

Ab initio calculations were performed to obtain several terms in the force field not yet defined in the literature. These include torsion energy profiles and distributions of atomic charges that blend smoothly with the OPLS-AA specification for alkyl chains. Validation was carried out by comparing simulated and experimental data on fourteen different salts, comprising three types of anion and five lengths of alkyl chain, in both the crystalline and liquid phases.

Ab initio quantum chemical calculations were employed to obtain molecular geometry, torsional energy profiles, and partial charge distribution in the triflate and bistriflylimide anions. One of the torsions in bistriflylimide, corresponding to the dihedral angle S−N−S−C, has a complex energy profile which is precisely reproduced by the present parameter set.

In this article, we review the recent progress in the development of analytical potential energy functions that aim at correctly representing many-body effects. Starting from the many-body expansion of the interaction energy, specific focus is on different classes of potential energy functions built upon a hierarchy of approximations and on their ability to accurately reproduce reference data obtained from state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements. We show that most recent potential energy functions, which include explicit short-range representations of two-body and three-body effects along with a physically correct description of many-body effects at all distances, predict the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase with unprecedented accuracy, thus opening the door to the long-sought “universal model” capable of describing the behavior of water under different conditions and in different environments.},

It therefore forms the basis for all molecular dynamics simulations of biological phenomena, as well as for many chemical, industrial, and materials investigations. Over the years, many water models have been developed, and it remains a challenge to find a single water model that accurately reproduces all experimental properties of water simultaneously. Here, we report a comprehensive comparison of structural and dynamic properties of 30 commonly used 3-point, 4-point, 5-point, and polarizable water models simulated using consistent settings and analysis methods. For the properties of density, coordination number, surface tension, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficient, and solvation free energy of methane, models published within the past two decades consistently show better agreement with experimental values compared to models published earlier, albeit with some notable exceptions. However, no single model reproduced all experimental values exactly, highlighting the need to carefully choose a water model for a particular study, depending on the phenomena of interest. Finally, machine learning algorithms quantified the relationship between the water model force field parameters and the resulting bulk properties, providing insight into the parameter–property relationship and illustrating the challenges of developing a water model that can accurately reproduce all properties of water simultaneously.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, viscosity, and conductivity) is one of the primary benefits of molecular simulation. Although most studies focus on the accuracy of the simulation output compared to experimental data, such a comparison primarily tests the adequacy of the force field (i.e. the model). By contrast, the reliability of different simulation methodologies for predicting transport properties is the focus of this manuscript. Unfortunately, obtaining reproducible estimates of transport properties from molecular simulation is not as straightforward as static properties. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the best practices that should be followed to ensure that the simulation output is reliable, i.e. is a valid representation of the force field implemented. We also discuss procedures to use so that the results are reproducible (i.e. can be obtained by other researchers following the same methods and procedures).
There are two classes by which transport properties are predicted: equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). This manuscript presents the best practices for EMD, leaving NEMD for a future publication. As self-diffusivity and shear viscosity are the most prevalent transport properties found in the literature, the discussion will also be limited to these properties with the expectation that future publications will discuss best practices for thermal conductivity, ionic conductivity, and multicomponent diffusivity.},

	abstract = {We present TRAVIS (“TRajectory Analyzer and VISualizer”), a free program package for analyzing and visualizing Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics trajectories. The aim of TRAVIS is to collect as many analyses as possible in one program, creating a powerful tool and making it unnecessary to use many different programs for evaluating simulations. This should greatly rationalize and simplify the workflow of analyzing trajectories. TRAVIS is written in C++, open-source freeware and licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3). It is easy to install (platform independent, no external libraries) and easy to use. In this article, we present some of the algorithms that are implemented in TRAVIS - many of them widely known for a long time, but some of them also to appear in literature for the first time. All shown analyses only require a standard MD trajectory as input data.},

	abstract = {Abstract This review covers a family of atomistic, mostly quantum chemistry (QC) based semiempirical methods for the fast and reasonably accurate description of large molecules in gas and condensed phase. The theory is derived from a density functional (DFT) perturbation expansion of the electron density in fluctuation terms to various orders similar to the original density functional tight binding model. The term “eXtended” in their name (xTB) emphasizes the parameter availability for almost the entire periodic table of elements (Z ≤ 86) and improvements of the underlying theory regarding, for example, the atomic orbital basis set, the level of multipole approximation and the treatment of the important electrostatic and dispersion interactions. A common feature of most members is their consistent parameterization on accurate gas phase theoretical reference data for geometries, vibrational frequencies and noncovalent interactions, which are the primary properties of interest in typical applications to systems composed of up to a few thousand atoms. Further specialized versions were developed for the description of electronic spectra and corresponding response properties. Besides a provided common theoretical background with some important implementation details in the efficient and free xtb program, various benchmarks for structural and thermochemical properties including (transition-)metal systems are discussed. The review is completed by recent extensions of the model to the force-field (FF) level as well as its application to solids under periodic boundary conditions. The general applicability together with the excellent cost-accuracy ratio and the high robustness make the xTB family of methods very attractive for various fields of computer-aided chemical research.

	abstract = {We introduce a fully stand-alone version of the Quantum Chemistry Electron Ionization Mass Spectra (QCEIMS) program [S. Grimme, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2013, 52, 6306] allowing efficient simulations for molecules composed of elements with atomic numbers up to Z = 86. The recently developed extended tight-binding semi-empirical method GFN-xTB has been combined with QCEIMS, thereby eliminating dependencies on third-party electronic structure software. Furthermore, for reasonable calculations of ionization potentials, as required by the method, a second tight-binding variant, IPEA-xTB, is introduced here. This novel combination of methods allows the automatic, fast and reasonably accurate computation of electron ionization mass spectra for structurally different molecules across the periodic table. In order to validate and inspect the transferability of the method, we perform large-scale simulations for some representative organic, organometallic, and main-group inorganic systems. Theoretical spectra for 23 molecules are compared directly to experimental data taken from standard databases. For the first time, realistic quantum chemistry based EI-MS for organometallic systems like ferrocene or copper(ii)acetylacetonate are presented. Compared to previously used semiempirical methods, GFN-xTB is faster, more robust, and yields overall higher quality spectra. The partially analysed theoretical reaction and fragmentation mechanisms are chemically reasonable and reveal in unprecedented detail the extreme complexity of high energy gas phase ion chemistry including complicated rearrangement reactions prior to dissociation.},

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

	abstract = {A quantum chemical method based on a Hartree-Fock calculation with a small Gaussian AO basis set is presented. Its main area of application is the computation of structures, vibrational frequencies, and noncovalent interaction energies in huge molecular systems. The method is suggested as a partial replacement of semiempirical approaches or density functional theory (DFT) in particular when self-interaction errors are acute. In order to get accurate results three physically plausible atom pair-wise correction terms are applied for London dispersion interactions (D3 scheme), basis set superposition error (gCP scheme), and short-ranged basis set incompleteness effects. In total nine global empirical parameters are used. This so-called Hartee-Fock-3c (HF-3c) method is tested for geometries of small organic molecules, interaction energies and geometries of noncovalently bound complexes, for supramolecular systems, and protein structures. In the majority of realistic test cases good results approaching large basis set DFT quality are obtained at a tiny fraction of computational cost. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {This paper develops two new hybrid meta exchange-correlation functionals for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and nonbonded interactions. The new functionals are called PW6B95 (6-parameter functional based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation) and PWB6K (6-parameter functional for kinetics based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation). The resulting methods were comparatively assessed against the MGAE109/3 main group atomization energy database, against the IP13/3 ionization potential database, against the EA13/3 electron affinity database, against the HTBH38/4 and NHTBH38/04 hydrogen-transfer and non-hydrogen-transfer barrier height databases, against the HB6/04 hydrogen bonding database, against the CT7/04 charge-transfer complex database, against the DI6/04 dipole interaction database, against the WI7/05 weak interaction database, and against the new PPS5/05 π−π stacking interaction database. From the assessment and comparison of methods, we draw the following conclusions, based on an analysis of mean unsigned errors: (i) The PW6B95, MPW1B95, B98, B97-1, and TPSS1KCIS methods give the best results for a combination of thermochemistry and nonbonded interactions. (ii) PWB6K, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and MPW1B95 give the best results for a combination of thermochemical kinetics and nonbonded interactions. (iii) PWB6K outperforms the MP2 method for nonbonded interactions. (iv) PW6B95 gives errors for main group covalent bond energies that are only 0.41 kcal (as measured by mean unsigned error per bond (MUEPB) for the MGAE109 database), as compared to 0.56 kcal/mol for the second best method and 0.92 kcal/mol for B3LYP.},

	title = {Consistent structures and interactions by density functional theory with small atomic orbital basis sets},

	doi = {10.1063/1.4927476},
	abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) based composite electronic structure approach is proposed to efficiently compute structures and interaction energies in large chemical systems. It is based on the well-known and numerically robust Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) generalized-gradient-approximation in a modified global hybrid functional with a relatively large amount of non-local Fock-exchange. The orbitals are expanded in Ahlrichs-type valence-double zeta atomic orbital (AO) Gaussian basis sets, which are available for many elements. In order to correct for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) and to account for the important long-range London dispersion effects, our well-established atom-pairwise potentials are used. In the design of the new method, particular attention has been paid to an accurate description of structural parameters in various covalent and non-covalent bonding situations as well as in periodic systems. Together with the recently proposed three-fold corrected (3c) Hartree-Fock method, the new composite scheme (termed PBEh-3c) represents the next member in a hierarchy of low-cost electronic structure approaches. They are mainly free of BSSE and account for most interactions in a physically sound and asymptotically correct manner. PBEh-3c yields good results for thermochemical properties in the huge GMTKN30 energy database. Furthermore, the method shows excellent performance for non-covalent interaction energies in small and large complexes. For evaluating its performance on equilibrium structures, a new compilation of standard test sets is suggested. These consist of small (light) molecules, partially flexible, medium-sized organic molecules, molecules comprising heavy main group elements, larger systems with long bonds, 3d-transition metal systems, non-covalently bound complexes (S22 and S66×8 sets), and peptide conformations. For these sets, overall deviations from accurate reference data are smaller than for various other tested DFT methods and reach that of triple-zeta AO basis set second-order perturbation theory (MP2/TZ) level at a tiny fraction of computational effort. Periodic calculations conducted for molecular crystals to test structures (including cell volumes) and sublimation enthalpies indicate very good accuracy competitive to computationally more involved plane-wave based calculations. PBEh-3c can be applied routinely to several hundreds of atoms on a single processor and it is suggested as a robust high-speed computational tool in theoretical chemistry and physics.},

	abstract = {In the past 30 years, density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as the most widely used electronic structure method to predict the properties of various systems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Despite a long history of successes, state-of-the-art DFT functionals have crucial limitations. In particular, significant systematic errors are observed for charge densities involving mobile charges and spins. Kirkpatrick et al. developed a framework to train a deep neural network on accurate chemical data and fractional electron constraints (see the Perspective by Perdew). The resulting functional outperforms traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. The present work offers a solution to a long-standing critical problem in DFT and demonstrates the success of combining DFT with the modern machine-learning methodology. —YS Deep learning solves a long-standing critical limitation of density functional theory in describing fractional charges and spins. Density functional theory describes matter at the quantum level, but all popular approximations suffer from systematic errors that arise from the violation of mathematical properties of the exact functional. We overcame this fundamental limitation by training a neural network on molecular data and on fictitious systems with fractional charge and spin. The resulting functional, DM21 (DeepMind 21), correctly describes typical examples of artificial charge delocalization and strong correlation and performs better than traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains, charged DNA base pairs, and diradical transition states. More crucially for the field, because our methodology relies on data and constraints, which are continually improving, it represents a viable pathway toward the exact universal functional.},

Metal-organic frameworks or biological macromolecules involve complex architectures and a large variety of elements. Yet, a general and broadly applicable theoretical method to describe the structures and interactions of molecules beyond the 1000-atom size regime semi-quantitatively is not self-evident. For this purpose, a generic force field named GFN-FF is presented, which is completely newly developed to enable fast structure optimizations and molecular-dynamics simulations for basically any chemical structure consisting of elements up to radon. The freely available computer program requires only starting coordinates and elemental composition as input from which, fully automatically, all potential-energy terms are constructed. GFN-FF outperforms other force fields in terms of generality and accuracy, approaching the performance of much more elaborate quantum-mechanical methods in many cases.},

	doi = {10.1002/jcc.20035},
	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

	abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.},

	abstract = {The scaling behavior of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for the different size bulk systems of liquid methanol is presented and thereby the characteristics of every system performing on either a local compute cluster or a supercomputer are analyzed. Additionally, the influence of different parameters on the quality of the infrared and Raman spectra is investigated using different simulation frameworks, including time step, convergence criteria, density functional approximation, and basis set. Both the maximally localized Wannier functions and the radical Voronoi tessellation approaches are employed to evaluate vibrational spectra from the trajectories. The results of infrared and Raman spectra are classified in two frequency regions, 500 to 1600 cm−1 and 2500 to 4000 cm−1, in order to compare and discuss the experimental spectra and the results derived from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations comprehensively. The outcome of this study guides future experimental and theoretical researchers in order to acquire a profound perception into vibrational spectra, which evolves the way of elucidating molecular structure.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach for calculating vibrational circular dichroism spectra by ab initio molecular dynamics. In the context of molecular dynamics, these spectra are given by the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function of magnetic dipole moment and electric dipole moment. We obtain the magnetic dipole moment from the electric current density according to the classical definition. The electric current density is computed by solving a partial differential equation derived from the continuity equation and the condition that eddy currents should be absent. In combination with a radical Voronoi tessellation, this yields an individual magnetic dipole moment for each molecule in a bulk phase simulation. Using the chiral alcohol 2-butanol as an example, we show that experimental spectra are reproduced very well. Our approach requires knowing only the electron density in each simulation step, and it is not restricted to any particular electronic structure method.},

In particular, we show mass-weighted power spectra, infrared spectra, and Raman spectra with corresponding depolarization ratios, which are based on time-correlation functions of velocities, dipole moments, and polarizabilities, respectively. Using the four organic molecules methanol, acetone, nitromethane, and pinacol as test systems, we compare the spectra from AIMD simulations of the isolated molecules in gas phase to static calculations relying on the harmonic approximation and to experimental spectra recorded in a nonpolar solvent. The AIMD approach turns out to give superior results when anharmonicity effects are of particular importance. Using the example of methanol, we demonstrate the application to bulk phase systems, which are not directly accessible by static calculations, but for which the AIMD spectra also provide a very good approximation to experimental data. Finally, we investigate the influence of simulation time and temperature in the AIMD on the resulting spectra.},

Nevertheless, we show at the examples of methanol, benzene, and phenol that it provides infrared and Raman spectra of similar quality and is even superior in specific cases like the Raman spectra of benzene and phenol.

This Perspective delineates the present status of the field from the efforts of others and some of our own work and discusses open questions and future prospects. The combination of physics-based long-range representations using multipolar charge distributions and kernel representations for the bonded interactions is shown to provide realistic models for the exploration of the infrared spectroscopy of molecules in solution. For reactions, empirical models connecting dedicated energy functions for the reactant and product states allow statistically meaningful sampling of conformational space whereas machine-learned energy functions are superior in accuracy. The future combination of physics-based models with machine-learning techniques and integration into all-purpose molecular simulation software provides a unique opportunity to bring such dynamics simulations closer to reality.},

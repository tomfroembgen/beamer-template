# poster template

Written by Tom Fr√∂mbgen for the Kirchner group at the University of Bonn.

## Usage

This is our template for scientific presentations. Feel free to adjust it to your needs, but please keep the overall design. See the [example talk](main.pdf) for a preview.

There are two main files of interest:
* [`main.tex`](main.tex) contains the actual content
* [`preamble.tex`](preamble.tex) contains the preamble and the style definitions

You might want to adjust the aspect ratio of the slides. This can be done in the first lines of [`main.tex`](main.tex). Moreover, there's the possibility to add secondary logos to the first and last slide.

Have fun.

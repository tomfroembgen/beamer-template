# poster template

Written by Tom Fr√∂mbgen for the Kirchner group at the University of Bonn.

## Usage

This is our template for scientific presentations. Feel free to adjust it to your needs, but please keep the overall design. Please do not modify this repository directly.

See the [example talk](main.pdf) for a preview.

There are two main files of interest:
* [`main.tex`](main.tex) contains the actual content
* [`preamble.tex`](preamble.tex) contains the preamble and the style definitions

You might want to adjust the aspect ratio of the slides. This can be done in the first lines of [`main.tex`](main.tex).

Have fun.
